previous pom was fail cause 
You are using JDK9 or later
Your project uses maven-compiler-plugin with an old version which defaults to Java 5.
You have three options to solve this

Downgrade to JDK7 or JDK8 (meh)
Use maven-compiler-plugin version or later, because
so  i add below lines at end before </project>
<properties>
    <maven.compiler.source>1.6</maven.compiler.source>
    <maven.compiler.target>1.6</maven.compiler.target>
  </properties>
so jenkins uses for this project which supports older version and it get succeed
